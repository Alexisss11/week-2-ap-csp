# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
# first_name = "Marvin"
# age = 30
# favorite_color = "Blue"
# favorite_number = 7

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers
# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
